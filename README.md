## Introduction

Welcome to my learning python project! This repository is a collection of Python exercises and their corresponding solutions, grouped by difficulty level. It is a reflection of my own learning process as I follow online tutorials and lessons,.

Currently, the repository primarily covers on the basics of Python programming, but I plan to update it with more advanced topics and exercises as I progress through my Python learning journey.

## Basics

The basics section of this repository covers a wide range of fundamental Python concepts, including:

- **Functions (making your own programs)**: Learn how to define and use functions to modularize your code and make it more reusable.

- **Arithmetic (basic maths)**: Explore the essential arithmetic operations in Python, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Expressions and statements (the building blocks of programs)**: Understand how to construct expressions and statements to perform various tasks in Python programs.

- **Strings (letters and words)**: Dive into working with strings, the core data type for representing text in Python.

- **Conditionals (ifs and elses)**: Master conditional statements to control the flow of your programs based on specific conditions.

- **Lists (sequences of items)**: Discover how to work with lists, a versatile data structure that can hold multiple items in a single variable.

- **Loops (whiles and fors)**: Learn how to use loops, including `while` and `for` loops, to iterate over data and perform repetitive tasks.

- **Dictionaries (pairs of items)**: Explore dictionaries, a key-value data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## Prerequisites
